"""
Given an array arr[] of size N and an integer K. Find the maximum for each and 
every non-contiguous subarray of size K

A naive solution to this problem is to calculate the sum of all possible subsequences with no adjacent elements 
and keep track of the subsequence with the maximum sum. 
The time complexity of this approach is O(n2)O(n^2)O(n​2​​).

This can be improved by using dynamic programming. Iterate over the entire input array, and in every iteration pick the maximum of these two values:
--Max Sum of the last iteration.
--Max Sum of second last iteration + current iteration index.
