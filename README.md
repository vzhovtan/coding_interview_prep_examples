## These are my exercise files for preparing to coding interview

* Some of them have been found on GitHub and used/modified with additional debugging, explanation, etc for better understanding of used algorithms
* Some of them are taken from online classes and books and modified while tested as well.
* Some created from scratch using question from online resources like LeetCode and Geek4Geek.
* Used Python only to concentrate on algorithms and not on language features.However, in some cases Python features are quite helpful and in case such Python specific modules or features have been used, marked such code as "Pythonic".
