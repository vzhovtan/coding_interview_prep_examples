## These are my exercise files for preparing to coding interview

Some of them have been found in the web and modified with additional debugging, explanation, etc for better understanding of algorithms, tips and tricks
Some of them are taken from online classes and books and modified while playing as well.
Some created from scratch using question from online resources like LeetCode and Geek4Geek.
Used Python only to concentrate on algorithms and not on language features, in case Python specific modules or tricks have been used, marked such code as "Pythonic".
