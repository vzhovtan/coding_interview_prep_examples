"""
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at 
index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the 
original array except the one at i.
For example, if our input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output 
would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected 
output would be [2, 3, 6].
